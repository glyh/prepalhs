# Rationale
I hate Haskell, in that the syntax design is too arbitrary and the result is unreadable. However, it's undeniable that there's a lot of valuable libraries that Haskell have, which present a lot of neat ideas on how the to program in a functional language. This one is an attempt to make the syntax easier on people's eyes and more readable with some ruby magic.

Moreover, I'm trying to design a language that use this syntax, but not based on haskell, so this is also a prototype justifying the syntactical choice I made on that project.
